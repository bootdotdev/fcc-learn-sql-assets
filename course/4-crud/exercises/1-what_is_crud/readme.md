# CRUD

CRUD is an acronym that stands for `CREATE`, `READ`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`. These four operations are the bread and butter of nearly every database you will create. 

## HTTP and CRUD

The CRUD operations correlate nicely with the HTTP methods we learned in the [Learn HTTP](https://boot.dev/learn/learn-http) course. 

* `HTTP POST` - `CREATE`
* `HTTP GET` - `READ`
* `HTTP PUT` - `UPDATE`
* `HTTP DELETE` - `DELETE`

## Assignment

We've created a table for you called `crud`, it's a toy table we're using for interview practice at CashPal.

Determine which SQL command can be used for a `READ` operation and use it to *read* all the fields in all the records in the `crud` table!
