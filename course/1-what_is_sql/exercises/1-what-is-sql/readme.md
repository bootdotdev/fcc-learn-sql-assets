# What is SQL?

Structured Query Language, or [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), is the primary programming language used to manage and interact with [relational databases](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-a-relational-database). SQL can perform various operations such as creating, updating, reading, and deleting records within a database.

## CashPal

In this course, we will be building the database for a pretend PayPal clone called *CashPal*! Storing information related to people's money, transactions, and identity is very important! So we will need to make sure we use proper conventions to build a safe, and reliable database architecture that our users can rely on.

## Assignment

I have provided a simple SQL statement for you that retrieves some records from a table. However there isn't a `people` table, the table in our database is called `users`. Fix the bug by changing `people` to `users` within the `SELECT` statement.
