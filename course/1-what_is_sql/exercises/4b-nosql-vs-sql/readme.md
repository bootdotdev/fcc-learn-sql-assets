# NoSQL vs SQL

When talking about SQL databases, we also have to mention the elephant in the room: [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL).

To put it simply, a NoSQL database is a database that does *not* use SQL (Structured Query Language). Each NoSQL typically has its own way of writing and executing queries. For example, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) uses MQL (MongoDB Query Language) and [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/) simply has a JSON API.

While most relational databases are fairly similar, NoSQL databases tend to be fairly unique and are used for more niche purposes. Some of the main differences between a SQL and NoSQL databases are:

1. NoSQL databases are usually non-relational, SQL databases are usually [relational](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-a-relational-database) (we'll talk more about what this means later).
2. SQL databases usually have a defined schema, NoSQL databases usually have dynamic schema.
3. SQL databases are table-based, NoSQL databases have a variety of different storage methods, such as document, key-value, graph, wide-column, and more.

## Types of NoSQL databases

* [Document Database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database)
* [Key-Value Store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key%E2%80%93value_database)
* [Wide-Column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-column_store)
* [Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database)

A few of the most popular NoSQL databases are:

* [MongoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB)
* [Cassandra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Cassandra)
* [CouchDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_CouchDB)
* [DynamoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_DynamoDB)
* [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/)
