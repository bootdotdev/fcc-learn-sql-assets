# Full Join

A `FULL JOIN` combines the result set of the `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN` commands. It returns *all* records from both from `table_a` and `table_b` regardless of whether or not they have matches.

## SQLite

Like `RIGHT JOIN`s, SQLite doesn't support `FULL JOIN`s but they are still important to know!
